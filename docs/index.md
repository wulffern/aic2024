I write all the lectures in markdown, and you can see the source at
[aic2024](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2024)

For the slides, I use [deckset](https://www.deckset.com) to play the slideshow.
I may also convert the slides to PDF to show them with my ipad.

I use a python script to convert the markdown slides into jekyll posts.

For some of the lectures, I'll upload an introduction video to the [AIC youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLybHXZ9FyEhZ3HT2KPzjY2bmMJupRX2M6)

A tutorial on the tools can be found at [https://wulffern.github.io/rply_ex0_sky130nm/](https://wulffern.github.io/rply_ex0_sky130nm/)

IPs, like digital cells for analog design, transistors, and a 9-bit ADC can be found at [https://wulffern.github.io/aicex/](https://wulffern.github.io/aicex/)

I've compiled all the lectures notes into a [book](https://analogicus.com/aic2024/assets/aic.pdf)
