# Run local tools 

I would strongly recommend that you install all tools locally on your system. 

You can find a getting started guide at [aicex: Getting
Started](https://analogicus.com/aicex/started/)


# Run tools on NTNU server

I've installed the tools on a server at NTNU. Contact me and I can add you if
you have a NTNU account.

## Login to server 

I assume, at this point in your studies, you know how to SSH to another machine.
If not, in my opinon, your education has failed you. 

If you don't know, and you're on WSL or Mac, then 

Setup a public/private key on your computer 

```bash 
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Then 

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub |ssh <your ntnu username>@tfe4188.it.ntnu.no "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```


And now you can do 

```bash 
ssh -c aes128-ctr -YC -o "ForwardX11Timeout 4W" <your ntnu username>@tfe4188.it.ntnu.no
```

That's a very long line to remember, so I setup an alias. Add the following to
your .bashrc 


```bash
alias ssh-x='ssh -c aes128-ctr -YC -o "ForwardX11Timeout 4W" '
alias sshn='ssh-x <your ntnu username>@tfe4188.it.ntnu.no'
```

Then `source ~/.bashrc` and you should be able to do

```bash 
sshn
```

and voila, you're on the TFE4188 server


## Setup public key towards github

Do 

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

And enter on most things, or if you're paranoid, add a passphrase

Then 
```bash 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
```

And add the public key to your github account. Settings - SSH and GPG keys 

## Clone repo 

After login into the server, do 

```bash 
mkdir pro 
cd pro
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wulffern/aicex.git
```

You need to add the following to your ~/.bashrc
```bash
export PDK_ROOT=/opt/pdk/share/pdk
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/eda/lib
export PATH=/opt/eda/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Make sure you load the settings before you proceed

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Setup your ngspice settings

Edit `~/.spiceinit` and add

```bash
set ngbehavior=hsa     ; set compatibility for reading PDK libs
set ng_nomodcheck      ; don't check the model parameters
set num_threads=8      ; CPU hardware threads available
set skywaterpdk
option noinit          ; don't print operating point data
option klu
optran 0 0 0 100p 2n 0 ; don't use dc operating point, but transient op
option opts
```

## Install cicconf 

``` bash
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/cicconf
python3 -m pip install .
```

## Update IPs

```sh
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/
cicconf update 
```


## Install cicsim

``` bash
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/cicsim
python3 -m pip install  .
```


## Check that magic and xschem works

To check that magic and xschem works

``` sh
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/sun_sar9b_sky130nm/work 
magic ../design/SUN_SAR9B_SKY130NM/SUNSAR_SAR9B_CV.mag &
xschem -b ../design/SUN_SAR9B_SKY130NM/SUNSAR_SAR9B_CV.sch &
```
