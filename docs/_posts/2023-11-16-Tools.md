# Run local tools 

I would strongly recommend that you install all tools locally on your system. 

You can find a getting started guide at [aicex: Getting
Started](https://analogicus.com/aicex/started/)


# Run tools on NTNU server

I've installed the tools on a server at NTNU. Contact me and I can add you if
you have a NTNU account.


After login into the server, do 

```bash 
mkdir pro 
cd pro
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wulffern/aicex.git
```

You need to add the following to your ~/.bashrc
```bash
export PDK_ROOT=/opt/pdk/share/pdk
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/eda/lib
export PATH=/opt/eda/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Make sure you load the settings before you proceed

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Install cicconf 

``` bash
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/cicconf
python3 -m pip install --user -e .
```

## Update IPs

```sh
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/
cicconf update 
```


## Install cicsim

``` bash
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/cicsim
python3 -m pip install --user -e .
```


## Check that magic and xschem works

To check that magic and xschem works

``` sh
cd ~/pro/aicex/ip/sun_sar9b_sky130nm/work 
magic ../design/SUN_SAR9B_SKY130NM/SUNSAR_SAR9B_CV.mag &
xschem -b ../design/SUN_SAR9B_SKY130NM/SUNSAR_SAR9B_CV.sch &
```
