In the spring of 2024 I'll lecture Advanced Integrated Circuits for the third
time. I have an inherent need to make things better, and the course is no
different.

In the first round I noticed that very little of what I had on slides, or
said in lectures, made it into the student brain. That annoyed me,
and I realized that probably a few things needed to change.

As I now prepare for the 3'rd semester, it will be interesting to see if
anything will be better. The sources are at [analogicus.com/aic2024](https://analogicus.com/aic2024/).


I love programming and automation. Not much makes me more happy than using the
same source (the [slide
markdowns](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2024/tree/main/lectures)), to generate the [lecture notes](https://analogicus.com/aic2024/), to translate
into the [book](https://analogicus.com/aic2024/assets/aic.pdf) your looking at right now.


If you find an error in what I've made, then [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) [aic2024](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2024), fix , [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request). That way, we use the global brain power most efficiently, and avoid multiple humans spending time on discovering the same error.
