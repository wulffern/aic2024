In the spring of 2024 I lectured Advanced Integrated Circuits for the third
time. I have an inherent need to make things better, and the course is no
different.

In the first round I noticed that  little of what I had on slides, or
said in lectures, made it into the student brain. That annoyed me,
and I realized that probably a few things needed to change.

I think the lectures have gotten better, but I don't have any specific proof. There were 19 students that took the
exam in 2024.  An indication of lecture quality could be attendance. I don't
have all the dates, but an average attendance of 76 % I think is pretty OK.

For the third semester I finally felt I achieved a balance. I spent Thursday's
preparing for the lecture, writing these notes, making a YouTube video (so I'll
remember next year what I wanted to talk about). I passed 1k subscribers.
Friday's I had the lecture and the group work. 


For the group work I forced students into groups, and I forced that they for the
first 5-10 minutes do a check-in. That I need to do next year too.

For the check in, they had go around in the group and answer one of the
following questions:

- What is one thing that is going on in your life (personal or professional)?
- What is one thing that you're grateful for right now?
- What is something funny that happened?

The check-in led to excellent team work for those students that showed up. 

Thanks to Jonathan for helping out in the exercise hours. 

I love programming and automation. Not much makes me more happy than using the
same source (the [slide
markdowns](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2024/tree/main/lectures)), to generate the [lecture notes](https://analogicus.com/aic2024/), to translate
into the [book](https://analogicus.com/aic2024/assets/aic.pdf) your looking at right now.


If you find an error in what I've made, then [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) [aic2024](https://github.com/wulffern/aic2024), fix , [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request). That way, we use the global brain power most efficiently, and avoid multiple humans spending time on discovering the same error.
