<!--pan_title: How to write a project report-->

# Why
> Them who has a Why? in life can tolerate almost any How?

You're writing the report on the project for me to be able to see inside
your head, and grade how much of the project you have understood. 

- Have you learned what is to be expected?
- Do you understand what you're trying to explain? 

You will work on the project in groups, however, on the report, you will write
on your own.

That means, that there will be X projects reports that describe the same
circuit. You shall not copy someone elses report text. 

It's fine to share figures between reports, and also references. 

I'm also forcing you to use a report format that matches well with what would be
expected if you were to publish a paper. 

Should you make a fantastic temperature sensor, and maybe even reach close to a
tapeout I would strongly suggest you submit a paper to 
[NorCas](https://events.tuni.fi/uploads/2023/12/8af07ce6-norcas2024_cfp.pdf).
The deadline is August 15 2024.

# On writing English

Writing well is important. I would recommend that you read [On writing
Well](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548).

Most of you won't buy the book, as such, a few tips.

## Shorter is better 

I can write the section title idea in many words: 

> A shorter text will more elequently describe the intricacies of your thoughts
> than a long, distinguished, tirade of carefully, wonderfully, choosen words. 

or 

> Shorter is better 

Describe an idea with as few words as possible. The text will be better, and
more readable. 

## Be careful with adjectives 

Words like "very, extremely, easily, simply, ..." don't belong in a readable
text. They serve no purpose. Delete them.

## Use paragraphs

You write a text to place ideas into anothers head. Ideas and thoughts are best
communicated in chunks. I can write a dense set of text, or I can split a dense
set of text into multiple paragraphs. The more I try to cram into a paragraph,
for example, how magical the weather has been the last weeks, with lots of snow,
and good skiing, the more difficult the paragraph is to read. 

One paragraph, one thought. For example:

You write a text to place ideas into anothers head. Ideas and thoughts are best
communicated in chunks. 

I can write a dense set of text, or I can split a dense
set of text into multiple paragraphs. 

The more I try to cram into a paragraph,
for example, how magical the weather has been the last weeks, with lots of snow,
and good skiing, the more difficult the paragraph is to read. 

## Don't be afraid of I 

If you did something, then say "I" in the text. If there were more people, then
use "we". 

## Transitions are important

Sentences within a paragraph are sometimes linked. Use 

- As a result,
- As such, 
- Accordingly,
- Consequently,

And mix them up. 

## However, is not a start of a sentence 

If you have to use "However" it should come in the middle of the sentence. 

I want to go skiing, however, I cannot today due to work. 

# Report Structure

The sections below go through the expected structure of a report, and what the 
sections should contain.

## Introduction

The purpose of the introduction is to put the reader into the right
frame of mind. Introduce the problem statement, key references, the key
contribution of your work, and an outline of the work presented. Think
of the introduction as explaining the "Why" of the work.

Although everyone has the same assignment for the project, you have
chosen to solve the problem in different ways. Explain what you consider
the problem statement, and tailor the problem statement to what the
reader will read.

Key references are introduced. Don't copy the paper
text, write why they designed the circuit, how they chose to implement
it, and what they achieved. The reason we reference other papers in the
introduction is to show that we understand the current state-of-the-art.
Provide a summary where state-of-the-art has moved since the original paper.

The outline should be included towards the end of the introduction. The
purpose of the outline is to make this document easy to read. A reader
should never be surprised by the text. All concepts should be eased
into. We don't want the reader to feel like they been thrown in at the
end of a long story. As such, if you chosen to solve the problem
statement in a way not previously solved in a key references, then you
should explain that.

A checklist for all chapters can be seen in table below.

## Theory

It is safe to assume that all readers have read the key references,
if they have not, then expect them to do so. 

The purpose of the theory section is not to demonstrate that you have read the references,
but rather, highlight theory that the reader probably does not know. 

The theory section should give sufficient explanation to bridge the gap
between references, and what you apply in this text.

## Implementation

The purpose of the implementation is to explain what you did. How have
you chosen to architect the solution, how did you split it up in analog
and digital parts? Use one subsection per circuit.

For the analog, explain the design decisions you made, how did you pick
the transistor sizes, and the currents. Did you make other choices than in the
references? How does the circuit work?  

For the digital, how did you divide up the digital? What were the design
choices you made?  How did you implement readout of the data? Explain
what you did, and how it works. Use state diagrams and block diagrams.

Use clear figures (i.e.
circuitikz), don't use pictures from schematic editors. 

## Result

The purpose of the results is to convince the reader that what you made
actually works. To do that, explain testbenches and simulation results.
The key to good results is to be critical of your own work. Do not try
to oversell the results. Your result should speak for themself.

For analog circuits, show results from each block. Highlight key
parameters, like current and delay of comparator. Demonstrate that the
full analog system works.

Show simulations that demonstrate that the digital works.

## Discussion

Explain what the circuit and results show. Be critical.

## Future work

Give some insight into what is missing in the work. What should be the
next steps?

## Conclusion

Summarize why, how, what and what the results show.

## Appendix

Include in appendix the necessary files to reproduce the work. One good
way to do it is to make a github repository with the files, and give a
link here.
